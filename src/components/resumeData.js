  aboutMe:
    "Hello! My name is Isuru and I come from a beautiful island called Sri Lanka. I wrote my first computer program in my freshman year of college. The journey so far has been challenging but enjoyable- I am so thankful to have gained the knowledge to solve even the subtlest problems around me. Working at both a start up and non-profit organization, I've learned how important it is to cater your ideas to the needs of the client or end-user. I've realized that my projects are meaningless without it.",
  roleDescription:
    " I love solving problems creatively by dabbling in new technologies and creating things. Currently, I am focused on immersing myself in all aspects of data science - from data engineering to data analysis."
